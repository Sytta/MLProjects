# Machine Learning Project 2 - Movie Recommender System 

**Submission ID**: 25003

## Set Up

Warning: This setup has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04. It is probable that the code won't run on a Windows System. Please make sure that your system has enough space (5G to be sure).

#### Packages where the machine learning algorithms are taken:

Sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

Spotlight: https://github.com/maciejkula/spotlight/tree/master/spotlight

Surprise: https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise

PyFM: https://github.com/coreylynch/pyFM

1. Make sure that the system has gcc and g++ compilers. If not, please do: ``` sudo apt-get install build-essential ``` in the terminal.
2. Download the all the zip files, unzip and make sure that you have the folder structure described below.
3. Make sure that you have Anaconda installed. If not, you can get the installer here: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/
4. Go in the folder, run ```conda env create -f MLenv.yml``` in terminal
5. Activate the environment by running ```source activate ML``` in terminal
6. Install Cython by running ``` conda install Cython``` in terminal (for some reason it won't install with the other packages)
7. Install PyFM by running ``` pip install git+https://github.com/coreylynch/pyFM``` in terminal

## How to get the submission.csv on CrowdAI?
1. Make sure that you have all the csvs in test_predictions and train_predictions listed above. If you want to generate yourself the csvs, go in src folder and run ```python3 produce_predict_csv.py option(choose a model) ```. 
    The available options are: 

    * ```als ``` (took us about 4.25 hrs) 
    * ```baseline ``` (took us about 20 min)
    * ```mfrr ``` (took us about 50 min)
    * ```pyfm ``` (took us about 2 hrs)
    * ```spotlight ``` (took us about 6 hrs)
    * ```surprise``` (took us about 16 hrs)

    Exemple of run: ```python3 produce_predict_csv.py baseline > produce_baseline.out & ```

2. Once you have all the csv produced and placed under the right folder (you can change ```constants.py``` to choose the folder where you want to put them), go to `src/` and run ```python3 run.py``` or run our jupyter notebook ```run.ipynb```. The submission file will be produce in this root folder.

## Results

We have obtained RMSE of 1.017 on CrowdAI.

## Possible Issues

* It is possible that with ALS (als.py), the numbers of the predictions might fluctuate a little (from 0.01 to 0.5 differences) in als_predictions.csv (not in submission.csv). We have not found the reason to this and we did not have enought time to investigate further. The small fluctuation does not seem to impact our results.
